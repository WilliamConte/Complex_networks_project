# Repo Overview
This repository contains the final project for the Physics of Complex Networks course, consisting of two complementary tasks that explore both theoretical modeling and practical network analysis.

This project consists of two main tasks:

Task #30: Axelrod Model for Dissemination of Culture
A comprehensive computational study of the Axelrod agent-based model, investigating how social influence shapes cultural traits in networked populations. The analysis explores phase transitions between cultural consensus and polarization across different network topologies.

Task #40: Subway Networks Analysis II
Data extraction and network analysis of subway systems from 8 major cities worldwide, including comprehensive structural characterization and comparative analysis of urban transportation networks.

The methodologies and main findings can be found explained in report.pdf, while simulation results are in the data directory and the code used in the code directory.
